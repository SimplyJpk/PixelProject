# PixelProject
 Small pixel based project that might become a game of sorts, mostly for learning and refreshing my c++.
 
 ## Build
 
 The project uses a few libraries which are included, and uses some packages which can be installed using nuget restore in the package manager of Visual Studio, once packages are installed it should be as simple as running build.
