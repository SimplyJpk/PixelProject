# PixelProject
 A fairly small pixel/falling-sand based project that might become a game of sorts, mostly for learning and refreshing my c++.
 
 Inspired after playing Noita and watching the [GDC video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prXuyMCgbTc) presented by the developers.
 
 ## Build
 
 The project uses a few libraries which are included, and uses some packages which can be installed using nuget restore in the package manager of Visual Studio, once packages are installed it should be as simple as running build.
 
 ## Libraries
 
 If you need to upgrade libraries, replace the required files inside the PixelProject/Includes and PixelProject/lib folders.
